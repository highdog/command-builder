## Overview

This document is the communication protocol between beyerdynamic mobile apps and headphones over Bluetooth.

The purpose of this document is to define the common protocol that can be reused between different headphone models
without reinventing the wheel for every earbud model.

**IMPORTANT!!!** The Messages marked as Mandatory must be implemented in every beyerdynamic earbuds model.

## 1. Bluetooth Transports

The protocol supports three Bluetooth transports:

- GATT over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Bluetooth RFCOMM (Android only)
- Apple MFI iAP2 (iOS only)

### 1.1. GATT over BLE Requirements

If beyerdynamic earbuds choose BLE to communicate with app, then they are required to support the following GATT
services and characteristics:

Device should advertise its MAC ADDRESS within the 6 bytes to 11 bytes of the kCBAdvDataManufacturerData. App will check
this MAC ADDRESS to determine if the device is a beyerdynamic device. This MAC ADDRESS should as same as the MAC ADDRESS which reported by A2DP.
Please always report the same MAC ADDRESS to the app, for example: even after a master-slave switch, the reported MAC ADDRESS should not change.

The following is an example. The part underlined in red is the MAC address:

<img src="assets/BLE-MAC-Address_Example.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

**IMPORTANT!!!**  If the device hasn't connected to mobile phone via A2DP, device should not start the BLE advertisement.

> TODO: We should consider a 16-bit Advertise Service UUID from Bluetooth SIG

### 1.2. RFCOMM Requirements

Beyerdynamic device that wants to exchange data over RFCOMM shall support one of the following RFCOMM channel UUID:

- If your device uses GAIA library: `54943f52-bd0d-48a0-855a-3b5471a6b4ab`
- Otherwise: `54943f52-bdfd-48a0-855a-3b5471a6b4ab`

This UUID is used for the main communication channel between the mobile app and the device
to change settings, get battery level, etc.

**Important:** RFCOMM messages might be grouped together in a single packet by Android sometimes
when multiple messages are sent soon after previous. In this case, the device will receive a byte array
that contains multiple messages with their own header, payload, etc.
The device should be able to handle this and separate messages from each other.
Use the payload length to identify where a message ends.

UUIDs for OTA libraries:

- WUQI OTA lib: `00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- Airoha SDK: `7b46e8de-5a7e-4512-be0d-863aeaa3312b`
- GAIA / QCC: `54943f52-bd0d-48a0-855a-3b5471a6b4ab`
- Realtek: `60ea72e7-3bb8-4035-8d66-6272120f1bac`
- BES: `54943f52-bdfd-48a0-855a-3b5471a6b4ab`

### 1.3. iAP2 Requirements

Beyerdynamic devices must be MFi certified and implement the iAP protocol in order to use RFCOMM on iOS. The device
shall use the External Accessory (EA) protocol name `com.beyerdynamic.headphones`.

For platforms where bundle identifier cannot be equal to the protocol name, the protocol name can be changed to `com.beyerdynamic.headphones.deviceName`.

## 2. Protocol Definition

Below you can find the protocol definition for the communication between the mobile app and the device:

- [RFCOMM Protocol Definition](#21-rfcomm-protocol-definition)
- [GATT over BLE Protocol Definition](#22-gatt-over-ble-protocol-definition)

The protocol is defined as a series of messages that can be sent between the mobile app and the device.

Note that for some platforms we might use a separate format. For example, for QCC platforms, we use GAIA client.
See [2.3. Protocol Definition for QCC Platform](#23-protocol-definition-for-qcc-platform) for more details.

### 2.1. RFCOMM Protocol Definition

RFCOMM beyerdynamic messages consist of 3 parts:

1. Header (8-9 bytes)
2. Optional payload (variable length)
3. Optional checksum (1 byte)

**Important:** RFCOMM messages might be grouped together in a single packet by Android sometimes
when multiple messages are sent soon after previous. In this case, the device will receive a byte array
that contains multiple messages, with each message having its own header, payload and checksum.
The device should be able to handle this and separate messages from each other.
Use the payload length and SOF flag to identify where a message ends and another message begins.

#### 2.1.1. Message Header

The message header is composed of 8 or 9 bytes that help identify and decode a message.
Each field is stored as Big Endian.

| **Parameter**  | **Size**    | **Description**                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SOF Flag       | 8-bit       | This is a constant 0xFF value. Used to identify the start of a new message.         |
| Version        | 8-bit       | The version of the protocol. The current version is 4.                              |
| Flags          | 8-bit       | Bit fields to exchange metadata.                                                    |
| Payload Length | 8 or 16-bit | Length of the message payload in bytes. 8 vs 16 bit length is controlled by a flag. |
| Vendor ID      | 16-bit      | Constant 0x2E50 for now.                                                            |
| Feature ID     | 7-bit       | Constant 0x11 for now.                                                              |
| Packet Type    | 2-bit       | Whether it is a command, a response, a notification, etc.                           |
| Command ID     | 7-bit       | Identifier of a specific message command (i.e. GetBatteryLevel).                    |

##### 2.1.1.1 SOF Flag

Type: uint8

Every message should begin with 0xFF.

If a message doesn't start with 0xFF, bytes are skipped until 0xFF is found.
The message then starts from that found 0xFF.

##### 2.1.1.2 Version

Type: uint8

This is primarily for future compatibility. For now, only version `4` is supported.

##### 2.1.1.3 Flags

Type: uint8 byte mask

Bits are counted from the least significant bit.

A value of `1` for that bit means it's set. `0` means not set.

| **Bit index** | **Name**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0             | CHECKSUM         | The flag is raised when the frame contains a checksum.                                                                                                                |
| 1             | LENGTH_EXTENSION | The flag is raised when the frame uses the length extension: two bytes to represent the payload length. If not set, payload length should be represented as one byte. |
| 2-7           |                  | Reserved                                                                                                                                                              |

Example:

- `0b00000000` - No flags are set.
- `0b00000001` - CHECKSUM flag is set.
- `0b00000010` - LENGTH_EXTENSION flag is set.
- `0b00000011` - Both CHECKSUM and LENGTH_EXTENSION flags are set.

##### 2.1.1.4 Payload Length

Type: uint8 or uint16

uint8 is used by default.
But if LENGTH_EXTENSION [flag](#2113-flags) is set, then uint16 is used instead and this header parameter occupies 2
bytes.

The size of the payload in this packet. Measured in bytes.

Payload length can be zero, meaning this packet has an empty payload.

##### 2.1.1.5 Vendor ID

Type: uint16

This is a constant 0x2E50 for now.

##### 2.1.1.6 Feature ID

Type: 7 bits

This is a constant 0x11 for now.

It is recommended to read 2 bytes at once.
And then take the most significant 7 bits of the first byte as Feature ID.
The least significant bit of the first byte and the most significant bit of the second byte is Packet Type.
The remaining 7 least significant bits of the second byte is Command ID.
7+2+7 = 16 bits = 2 bytes.

##### 2.1.1.7 Packet type

Type: 2 bits

| **Value** | **Name**     | **Description**                                                                                            |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00      | COMMAND      | A COMMAND is expected to be sent from mobile side to the device.                                           |
| 0x01      | NOTIFICATION | A NOTIFICATION is expected to be sent from the device to the mobile side as a spontaneous message.         |
| 0x02      | RESPONSE     | A RESPONSE is expected to be sent from the device to the mobile side as a successful answer to a COMMAND.  |
| 0x03      | ERROR        | An ERROR is expected to be sent from the device to the mobile side as an unsuccessful answer to a COMMAND. |

It is recommended to read 2 bytes at once.
And then take the most significant 7 bits of the first byte as Feature ID.
The least significant bit of the first byte and the most significant bit of the second byte is Packet Type.
The remaining 7 least significant bits of the second byte is Command ID.
7+2+7 = 16 bits = 2 bytes.

See [5. Example Package Flow](#5-example-package-flow) for an example of how each packet type is used.

##### 2.1.1.8 Command ID

Type: 7 bits

Signals the type of the command or notification sent between mobile side and the device.

See [3. Message Definition](#3-message-definition) for possible command ID values.

It is recommended to read 2 bytes at once.
And then take the most significant 7 bits of the first byte as Feature ID.
The least significant bit of the first byte and the most significant bit of the second byte is Packet Type.
The remaining 7 least significant bits of the second byte is Command ID.
7+2+7 = 16 bits = 2 bytes.

#### 2.1.2. Message Payload

Type: binary (variable length)

Every message should contain a payload that has length equal to the one set in [payload length](#2114-payload-length).

Payload length can be zero, meaning this packet has an empty payload.

See [3. Message Definition](#3-message-definition) for acceptable message payload formats for each Command ID.

#### 2.1.3. Checksum

Type: absent or uint8

Checksum should be present only if CHECKSUM [flag](#2113-flags) is set.

Checksum is calculated by doing bitwise XOR for each byte within header+payload.
header+payload is all bytes in the packet except the last checksum byte.

If checksum does not match, the packet should be ignored.

```java
if (hasChecksum) {
    result[frameLength - 1] = calculateChecksum(result, frameLength - 1);
}

private byte calculateChecksum(byte[] source, int length) {
    byte check = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        check ^= source[i];
    }
    return check;
}
```

Most earbuds don't need checksums. It is needed primarily if your device has reliability issues,
like BT transmission issues, accidentally sending several BT packets simultaneously,
missing bytes, etc. Please let us know if your device needs a checksum.

Checksum in device竊知obile packets is always checked if it is present.

### 2.2. GATT over BLE Protocol Definition

BLE beyerdynamic messages consist of 2 parts:

1. Header (4 bytes)
2. Optional payload (variable length)

#### 2.2.1. Message Header

The message header is composed of 4 bytes that help identify and decode a message.

| **Parameter** | **Size** | **Description**                                                  |

##### 2.2.1.4 Command ID

Type: 7 bits

Signals the type of the command or notification sent between mobile side and the device.

See [3. Message Definition](#3-message-definition) for possible command ID values.

### 2.3. Protocol Definition for QCC Platform

We use GAIA client for QCC platforms. Please use GAIA's protocol for QCC platforms, but use the same
vendor ID, feature ID, command IDs and payload formats as defined in this document under
[2.1. RFCOMM Protocol Definition](#21-rfcomm-protocol-definition) and
[2.2. GATT over BLE Protocol Definition](#22-gatt-over-ble-protocol-definition).

The firmware should also support the critical commands that GAIA uses internally, like GET_API_VERSION.

If the remaining battery time is i.e. 3h 10m, the app will display as `3h`.
If 3h 40m, the app will show `3.5h`.
If battery time is less than 30 minutes, the app will then show the exact remaining time in minutes.
This is done on the app's side, so earbuds can simply return the exact time.

Examples for earbuds:

Consider payload `0x07 0x1E 0x07 0x00`.
(0x1E = 30 in decimal.)
In this example, the remaining battery time is:

- For the left earbud - 7 hours and 30 minutes.
- For the right earbud - 7 hours and 0 minutes.

For payload `0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0x34`:
(0x34 = 52 in decimal.)
In this example, the remaining battery time is:

- The left earbud is offline or not reachable.
- For the right earbud - 0 hours and 52 minutes. The app will show as `0.5h`.

See [0x44 Get Equalizer Mode](#0x44-get-equalizer-mode) for equalizer mode payload specification.

The same equalizer mode payload version that is used for getting the equalizer mode should be used for setting the equalizer mode.

**Note for payload v2:**
The COMMAND request *can* include only the EQ types that are intended to be changed.
In this case, the RESPONSE payload should contain only the EQ types that were changed
with the COMMAND request.

### 0x46 Get User Equalizer Configuration

Command ID: 0x46

Default value: [0, 0, ..., 0] - Flat

This message allows changing current equalizer mode.

| **Packet Type** | **Payload**                          | **Notes**                                      |

There are two versions of the user equalizer configuration payload.
Let us know which version of the payload your device supports.
v2 supports floating-point values, while v1 supports integers only.
v3 supports different user EQs for music vs. gaming vs. ANC.

It is also possible to use platform SDKs for EQ configuration on Airoha and QCC platforms,
but we recommend using Beyerdynamic protocol commands for EQ configuration if possible.

##### User equalizer configuration v3 payload:

The payload **consists of an array of *variable-length* items**:

| **Byte Index** | **Type**            | **Description** |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 0 to S         | User EQ config item | Item 1          |
| (S+1) to K     | User EQ config item | Item 2          |
| (K+1) to M     | User EQ config item | Item 3          |
| ...            | ...                 | ...             |

Each user EQ config item:

| **Byte Index**   | **Type** | **Description**                            |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0                | uint8    | EQ type enum.                              |
| 1-2              | sint16   | Gain for the first band multiplied by 60.  |
| 3-4              | sint16   | Gain for the second band multiplied by 60. |
| ...              | ...      | ...                                        |
| (N\*2-1)..(N\*2) | sint16   | Gain for the Nth band multiplied by 60.    |

EQ type enum values:

Please see [Equalizer mode v2 payload](#equalizer-mode-v2-payload) for the EQ type enum values.
It is reused.

The number of bands (N) is device-specific.
It is hardcoded on both app and firmware side for each device model and should be agreed separately.
The number (N) can be different for each EQ type.

The gain is a 16-bit signed number.
The serialized value is 60 times the gain in decibels.
For example, a gain of +9.6 dB is represented by a serialized value of 576 (0x0240, 9.6ﾃ60).

The response payload should contain only the EQ types that are supported by the device.

##### User equalizer configuration v2 payload:

| **Byte Index**     | **Type** | **Description**                            |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0..1               | sint16   | Gain for the first band multiplied by 60.  |
| 2..3               | sint16   | Gain for the second band multiplied by 60. |
| ...                | ...      | ...                                        |
| (N\*2-2)..(N\*2-1) | sint16   | Gain for the Nth band multiplied by 60.    |

The gain is a 16-bit signed number.
The serialized value is 60 times the gain in decibels.
For example, a gain of +9.6 dB is represented by a serialized value of 576 (0x0240, 9.6ﾃ60).

##### User equalizer configuration v1 payload:

| **Byte Index** | **Type** | **Description**           |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 0              | sint8    | Gain for the first band.  |
| 1              | sint8    | Gain for the second band. |
| ...            | ...      | ...                       |
| N-1            | sint8    | Gain for the Nth band.    |

##### Using platform SDKs for EQ configuration (Airoha, QCC):

It is preferred to use Beyerdynamic protocol commands for EQ configuration.
But if you can't support it, then you can use your platform's platform SDK for EQ configuration.
Please let the mobile team know if you can't support Beyerdynamic's EQ configuration protocol.

[0x44 Get Equalizer Mode](#0x44-get-equalizer-mode) and [0x45 Set Equalizer Mode](#0x45-set-equalizer-mode)
commands should still be used to change the equalizer mode on these platforms.

**Note for SPP on Airoha platforms:** Android app will send platform EQ commands via Beyerdynamic's
SPP connection on `54943f52-bdfd-48a0-855a-3b5471a6b4ab` UUID.
This means that the firmware will receive both BY protocol commands and platform EQ commands on the same SPP connection.
The firmware should handle both types of commands on the same SPP connection.
This is because most platforms don't support multiple SPP connections at the same time.

### 0x47 Set User Equalizer Configuration

Command ID: 0x47

This message allows changing current user equalizer configuration.

| **Packet Type** | **Payload**                          | **Notes**                                                                                                          |

See [0x46 Get User Equalizer Configuration](#0x46-get-user-equalizer-configuration) for user equalizer
configuration payload specification.
The same payload version that you use for [0x46 Get User Equalizer Configuration](#0x46-get-user-equalizer-configuration)
should be used for [0x47 Set User Equalizer Configuration](#0x47-set-user-equalizer-configuration).
If you use your platform's SDK for EQ configuration, then you don't need to implement this command.

**Note for payload v3:**
The COMMAND request *can* include only the EQ types that are intended to be changed.
In this case, the RESPONSE payload should contain only the EQ types that were changed
with the COMMAND request.

## 4. Firmware Over-the-Air Updates (FOTA)

FOTA depends very much on the device chipset, so it needs to be tailored per-platform.

For the OTA solutions of the following platforms, we still adopt the communication protocol header of this protocol:
- WUQI platform with IAP2
- BES platform with SPP and BLE

The OTA package format is almost the same as outlined in [2.1. RFCOMM Protocol Definition](#21-rfcomm-protocol-definition), with only the message header being slightly different, as compared to [2.2.1. Message Header](#221-message-header):

| **Parameter**  | **Size**    | **Description**                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SOF Flag       | 8-bit       | This is a constant 0xFF value. Used to identify the start of a new message.         |
| Version        | 8-bit       | The version of the protocol. The current version is 4.                              |
| Flags          | 8-bit       | Bit fields to exchange metadata.                                                    |
| Payload Length | 8 or 16-bit | Length of the message payload in bytes. 8 vs 16 bit length is controlled by a flag. |
| Vendor ID      | 16-bit      | Constant 0x2E50                                                                     |
| Feature ID     | 7-bit       | Constant *0x06* for OTA.                                                            |
| Reserve        | 1-bit       | 0x0                                                                                 |

You can think of the beyerdynamic protocol as an channel, and the chipset platform's OTA packages are encapsulated within this channel.

## 5. Example Package Flow

Below you can find an example package flow between mobile and earbuds for getting the battery level.

**Note:** This is an example for one of the messages. Please consult [3. Message Definition](#3-message-definition) for
the supported packet types and their payloads.

#### 5.1. GetBatteryLevel command

![](assets/GetBatteryLevel-success.png)

Mobile side can request the battery level of the earbuds by sending a GetBatteryLevel COMMAND message to the earbuds
at any time. This can be used when the mobile side connects to the product and needs to figure out the current battery
level and what earbuds are connected.

Once the earbuds receive a GetBatteryLevel COMMAND message, they should respond with a GetBatteryLevel RESPONSE message
containing the current battery level state.

If there is any error processing the COMMAND message, the earbuds should respond with a GetBatteryLevel ERROR message:

![](assets/GetBatteryLevel-error.png)

Mobile side has a timeout for waiting for a response. If the earbuds do not respond within the timeout, the mobile side
will assume the command failed and might retry the command.

#### 5.2. GetBatteryLevel changed notification

![](assets/GetBatteryLevel-changed.png)

If the battery level of the earbuds changes, the earbuds are supposed to send a GetBatteryLevel NOTIFICATION message
to the mobile side. Mobile side does not use periodic polling to figure out when the battery level changes.

#### 5.3. GetBatteryLevel earbud disconnected notification

![](assets/GetBatteryLevel-earbud-disconnected.png)

Same as [5.2. GetBatteryLevel changed notification](#52-getbatterylevel-changed-notification).
When an earbud piece goes offline or online, the earbuds are supposed to send a GetBatteryLevel NOTIFICATION message.

Mobile side uses GetBatteryLevel command to figure out what earbuds are connected, so it needs to know when this
changes.

## 7. Testing

To verify your implementation of the protocol, you can use our debug apps for testing Bluetooth connections:

### Android

#### Overview

Please contact us for the download link of the Beyerdynamic debug app.

From that link, install the latest APK by date in its name (i.e. `2024-05-08.apk`).

This app has 2 icons on the main screen launcher:

- **Beyerdynamic** - This is the main app that will be released to the public. It might not support your device yet.
- **BY: Debug Connection** - This is the debug app that you can use to test the connection.

Think of them as 2 separate apps within the same APK file.

#### Connecting to a Device

To connect to your device using the debug app, follow these steps:

1. Open the **BY: Debug Connection** app:

![Android Debug App](assets/Screenshot_20240508-205417.png)

2. Grant the necessary permissions if asked.

Now the app should scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and show them in the list.
Note that the app shows only devices that are connected to the phone via A2DP and/or HFP profiles.
If your device doesn't show up in the list, make sure it's connected to the phone via A2DP and/or HFP profiles.
At least one of those profiles should be connected for this device to the phone for it to show up in the list.

<img src="assets/Screenshot_20240508-205139.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Once you see your Bluetooth device in the list:

1. Select the chipset type of your device. This is primarily used for deciding which OTA library to use.
2. Check the SPP UUID below Chipset type.
   This is the UUID that the app will use to connect to the device via SPP.
   Click on "Change" if you want to connect to a different UUID.
3. Click on the device in the list to connect to it.

Now the app should attempt to connect to the device via SPP on the selected UUID.

If the connection is successful, you should see the following screen:

<img src="assets/Screenshot_20240508-205700.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

If the connection is not successful, you will see a toast message with the error.
You will be redirected back to the devices list screen.
Please ensure you use the correct UUID for SPP and that the device can accept SPP connections on that UUID,
then try again.

#### Testing Commands

Once you are connected to the device, you will see the list of commands supported by this debug app.

To send a message with a specific command ID, click on the "Send" button next to that command ID.
The app might ask you to provide additional input if the command requires it.

Once a response from the device is received for that command ID,
it will be shown in the command ID card.
If there is an error parsing the response, the app will show an error message in place of the response.

The top half of the screen shows communication logs between the app and the device.
Think of it as a table with columns: Timestamp, Direction, Command ID, Packet Type, and Payload.
Direction '竊' means the app sent the message to the device,
and '竊' means the app received the message from the device.

You can disconnect from the device at any time by clicking on the "Disconnect" button at
the top of the command IDs list.

> If you believe the app does not send or parse commands correctly,
> please reach out to us. We will be happy to help you.

#### FOTA

The debug app also supports firmware OTA updates using chipset's OTA library.

To use FOTA:

1. Ensure the debug app is connected to your Bluetooth device and that you specified chipset type correctly.
2. Click on the "FOTA" button at the top of the commands list.
3. Select the firmware file you want to flash:

<img src="assets/Screenshot_20240508-210639.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Once an OTA file is picked, the app will attempt to flash the firmware to the device.
The app will show the progress of the flashing process.

Once the OTA finishes, the app will either transition to Completed or Failed state.
Click on "Close" button to return back to previous screens.

If the OTA update process fails and you believe the issue is on app's side,
please also try the same OTA file with your platform's official app for FOTA to verify the issue.
You can find some official FOTA apps in the folder where you downloaded the BY debug app APK.
Please reach out to us if OTA works with the official app but not with the debug app.

#### Extracting App Logs

If you encounter any issues with the app, you can extract the app logs for debugging purposes.
To do this:

1. Open a file system browser app on your phone.
2. Navigate to:
    - Android 10+: `Documents/Beyerdynamic/`
    - Android 8-9: `Android/data/com.beyerdynamic.app/files/`

You should see multiple log files in this folder.
Each file contains logs for a specific app launch.
File name is the time (in UTC) when the app was launched.
Please send us the log file that corresponds to the app launch where you encountered the issue.

#### Copying OTA Files to Main User-Facing App

Once the main user-facing Beyerdynamic app adds support for your device model,
you can use it for testing with your device as well.

You can test OTA also in this app.
The app, by default, will download the OTA files from our server.
However, this server might have poor speed when accessed from China.

In this case, you can push your OTA files into the app storage manually and skip the download step.

**Note:** This works only in debug apps downloaded from the link we provide you.
It will not work if the app was downloaded from Play Store or if the app is for QA.

To push OTA files into the app storage:

1. Install `adb` onto your PC. Follow steps [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/)
   to install `adb` and configure your phone for USB debugging.
2. Make sure the debug app is installed on your phone.
3. Force-stop the BY app on your phone.
4. Open a terminal on your PC and run the following commands:

```bash
adb push <Path-To-OTA-file-on-PC> /data/local/tmp/<DeviceType>-<Version>.bin
adb shell run-as com.beyerdynamic.app rm -f files/ota/<DeviceType>-<Version>.bin
adb shell run-as com.beyerdynamic.app mkdir -p files/ota
adb shell run-as com.beyerdynamic.app cp /data/local/tmp/<DeviceType>-<Version>.bin files/ota
adb shell rm /data/local/tmp/<DeviceType>-<Version>.bin
```

Replace `<Path-To-OTA-file-on-PC>` with the path to the OTA file on your PC.
Replace `<Device-Type>` with the device model name as specified in [0x00 Get Device Type](#0x00-get-device-type).
Replace `<Version>` with the version name of the release as specified on the OTA files storage server.
I.e. `adb push /path/to/ota-file.bin /data/local/tmp/VERIO_100-1.5.0.bin`.

Some phones might throw an error that some commands are not found or are not allowed.
You can try a different phone in that case.

Now the OTA file is pushed into the app storage.
You can now open the BY app,
and the app should notify you that a new OTA update is available for your device.

Once OTA update finishes, the app will delete the OTA file from its storage,
so you will need to push the file again if you want to test the OTA update again.
